As a senior strategy executive, I navigate complex business, technology, and policy environments to identify new capabilities, strategic partnerships, and market opportunities at the intersection of **healthcare, AI, and innovation**.

My background spans transformational leadership, intelligence and analytics, ethics and equity, and multidimensional risk management — with a proven track record of strategy formulation, execution, and operations. I build and lead diverse, distributed teams with a deep commitment to mission impact.
